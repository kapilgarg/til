# Covariance


In the context of stocks, Covariance is a statistical measure, used to measure if 2 stocks move in the same direction when market changes i.e. if one stock moves up, other stock moves in the same direction (up) or in the opposite direction(down)
Positive value indicates that both the stocks moves in same direction and negative value indicates that they move in opposite direction.
## Calculate
If X and Y indicates two stocks , then 
cov(X,Y) = Σ(Return_X - Average_return_X)*(Return_Y - Average_return_Y) / sampleSize-1
